      <h2> Challenges </h2>
      Overall, I thought this project was challenging but specifically the grid setup and skeleton was the hardest part for me. The photos on page one were not aligning the way I wanted them to and I grew very frustarated. I also had trouble with the appearance of my navigation bar and setting it up. I managed to get it working to some extent but I am not sure if it is a fixed navigation bar or not.

      <h2> Perks </h2>
      My favorite part of this porject was the CodePen animation tutorial on the second page. I though this was fun and interesting to play around wtih and try and change the colors and such. I also liked the design aspect of this project. I enjoy picking out different colors and fonts and seeing what goes together. I really liked and found the code pen animation very interesting and fun to do.  I used multiple different resources in this project including the skeleton website which was not as helpful as I thought it would be.  The resource that I used most frequently was just plain old google as well as the w3schools website which has very helpful information on CSS and HTML.

      <h2>Resources </h2>
      The resources that I used for this project I found of off Google and the class website. The skeleton website itself had some information but I did not find it to be very helpful.  I thought they could have added a few more examples or tutorials to make it easier to use. A website that I consistently find helpful is w3schools.com. They have a wealth of information on both HTML and CSS that usually helps to answer my questions.

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      I really wanted to use a patterned background for me website but in the end I decided that it was too busy and made the words too difficult to read. I will defintely keep that in mind for future projects. I would defintely improve my navigation bar because I think it is a tad on the boring side. I would definitely improve my photo page as a whole. I was not happy with how it turned out but I was just having too many problems with that page. I also would changed the size of my headers on each page becuase I feel that they are somewhat small but I was having some difficulty with that.
